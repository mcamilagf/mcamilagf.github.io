            <h2>Section 1: GDP and Life Expectancy</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Life expectancy and GDP vary significantly across continents. North America and Europe typically enjoy higher GDP and longer life expectancies due to better healthcare and living standards. 
                In contrast, many African countries face lower GDP and shorter life expectancies due to health challenges. 
                Asia presents a mixed picture, with high life expectancy and GDP in countries like Japan and South Korea, while others in South and Southeast Asia have lower figures. 
                Overall, higher GDP is strongly correlated with increased life expectancy, underscoring the influence of economic development on health outcomes.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                In 2022, GDP per capita varied significantly among the United Kingdom, United States, China, Congo, Nigeria, and India. 
                The United States had the highest per capita income, followed closely by the United Kingdom. 
                China’s GDP per capita was lower but marked by impressive growth. India’s income was moderate, while Nigeria and the Congo had among the lowest GDP per capita, reflecting ongoing economic and developmental challenges.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                From 1990 to 2022, real GDP per capita in the United States and United Kingdom grew steadily, with occasional dips like during the 2008 crisis.
                China saw rapid growth due to economic reforms, significantly boosting its per capita income. 
                India experienced solid growth from liberalization, though more gradual than China. 
                The Congo, however, faced slow growth due to political and economic challenges, keeping its GDP per capita among the lowest

        <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
            The Philippines has made significant progress in gender parity, with strong female participation in education, health, and leadership roles. 
            In contrast, Pakistan faces major challenges, ranking low due to cultural and social barriers that limit women's access to education and work. 
            While the Philippines shows notable gender equality, Pakistan continues to struggle with deep-rooted societal constraints.

    <h2>Section 5: Inflation since 1800</h2>
    <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
        Since 1800, worldwide inflation has fluctuated due to significant economic, political, and technological changes. 
        The 19th century generally experienced low and stable inflation, except during major events like wars and gold discoveries. 
        The 20th century brought more volatility, with hyperinflation episodes following World War I and II in several countries and the oil crises of the 1970s triggering global inflation surges. 
        Economic stabilization efforts in the late 20th century led to more controlled inflation rates in developed economies. 
        The 21st century has seen periods of both low inflation and deflation, until the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain disruptions, alongside geopolitical tensions, drove a resurgence of inflation globally by the early 2020s.

    <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
        From 1980 to 2022, GDP in constant prices showed distinct patterns across the Congo, United Kingdom, Kenya, and Japan. 
        The UK and Japan, as advanced economies, experienced strong growth until setbacks like Japan's 1990s stagnation and the 2008 financial crisis. 
        Kenya's GDP grew steadily due to expanding sectors, while the Congo faced volatility from political and economic challenges. 
        By 2022, the UK and Japan maintained higher GDPs, with Kenya showing consistent growth and the Congo continuing to struggle with economic stability.

    <h2>Section 7: Unemployment rate in Germany (2000-2022)</h2>
    <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
        Between 2000 and 2022, Germany's unemployment rate fluctuated significantly. It peaked around 11% in 2005 due to economic challenges but steadily declined. By 2019, it reached a low of about 3.2% due to economic growth. 
        The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 briefly increased unemployment, but government support helped stabilize the rate, which remained low by 2022.

            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                Real weekly wages in the UK from 2000 to 2024 have fluctuated significantly due to economic conditions and inflation.
                After steady growth in the early 2000s, wages stagnated following the 2008 financial crisis and struggled to recover in subsequent years.
                The COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted wage growth, although government support measures helped stabilize incomes.
                By 2024, while real weekly wages are anticipated to have improved, rising living costs and inflation continue to challenge workers' purchasing power.
